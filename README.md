# Factory-IO-----PID-tank-level
Factory IO -- PID tank level solution.

TIA PORTAL and Twincat 3 solution is attached. I don't have a video yet but soon, I will share youtube link. 

TIA PORTAL:

I didn't think SCL language is required for this project so the program is written in LAD language.

This PID values can be used if you want to have no overshoot and steady-state error. 

Twincat 3 : 

Program is written in ST language.

This PID values can be used. Minimum overshoot. No steady-state error, but slow reaction time.
